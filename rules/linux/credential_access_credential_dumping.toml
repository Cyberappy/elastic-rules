### Investigating Credential Dumping via Unshadow

Unshadow is a utility part of John the Ripper, a password-cracking tool that retrieves the combined contents of the '/etc/shadow' and '/etc/password' files. Attackers can use the combined file generated as input for password-cracking utilities, which can lead to account compromise.

This rule identifies the execution of the unshadow utility, which can potentially indicate an attacker gathering credentials for post-exploitation or lateral movement.

#### Possible investigation steps

- Identify the session entry leader and session user.
- Examine the contents of the session leading to the unshadow activity via the Session View.
- Examine the command execution pattern in the session, which may lead to suspicious activities.
- Examine the command execution after the unshadow activity to detect any exfiltration of shadow file data.
- If the analysis has shown exfiltration of cracked password data, analyse the impact of data that has been exfiltrated.
- Investigate other alerts associated with the user/host during the past 48 hours.

### Response and remediation

- Initiate the incident response process based on the outcome of the triage.
- Terminate the suspicious active session of a malicious user who gained access through a cracked password on the host.
- Isolate the involved host to prevent further post-compromise behavior.
- Perform a comprehensive examination of the compromised credentials that might have been used for unauthorized access or data exfiltration, and temporarily prevent their usage until a thorough analysis is conducted. Additionally, reset those passwords before allowing any further usage.
- Determine the initial vector abused by the attacker and take action to prevent reinfection through the same vector.
- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).
